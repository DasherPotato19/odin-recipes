    <h2 class="tomato">Description</h2>
    <p>Soups are a wonderful way to eat vegetables and stay warm during
    winter. Tomato soup in particular is wonderful, as it has a very
    unique <em>umami</em> taste, with the cooked tomato and the vegetables.
    </p>

    <p>Just eating it by itself is good enough, but it pairs very well with
    a <a href="./grilled-cheese.html">grilled cheese sandwich</a>. You dip it, then you eat it, and it tastes
    wonderfully. 
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li><em><strong>(Optional)</strong> carrots, celery and/or bell pepper</em></li>
            <li><em><strong>(Optional)</strong> smoked paprika, basil, and whatever spice you like</em></li>
            <li><em><strong>(Optional)</strong> vegetable broth</em></li>
            <li><em><strong>(Optional)</strong> some kind of alcohol, like cheap wine.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="tomato">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Mise en place:</em> get everything ready before starting to cook;
        chop the onion, garlic, and the rest of the vegetables. They don't need to
        be small, so you can just cut them into big chunks, but as you like. Open the tomato
        cans, and have all the ingredients to hand.</li>
        <li>Heat a pot on medium-high and throw some oil once it's hot. Then, throw the garlic. Once it
        starts to <em>"dance"</em> (which you will notice because it seems like the
        garlic is like jumping) throw in the rest of the vegetables. Stirfry until they
        are golden, or for as long as you like (making sure they don't burn).</li>
        <li>Now, throw in the tomatoes and the broth, and season with salt, pepper and a teaspoon
        of sugar (this is to avoid it from getting too sour). Once you threw in the tomatoes, turn down
        the fire and fill the cans with water, shake them and throw in the liquid (it will have lots of extra
        tomato chunks).</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and cook on low heat for at least 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use a blender or food processor to blend the soup until it's nice and creamy.</li>
        <li>Before serving it, heat up some cream or cream cheese in the microwave, and drop a
        spoon of it into the soup. You can decorate it with some basil, and even eat it with
        a <a href="./grilled-cheese.html">grilled cheese sandwich</a> if you like. <strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h3><span id="tips">Tips</span> and <span id="warnings">warnings</span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you want, you can deglaze the vegetables once ready, before throwing in the
        tomatoes. To do this, throw in a bit of the alcohol and scrape the bottom of the
        pot, and let the liquid evaporte (it won't take too long, don't worry).</li>
        <li>While it's cooking, the soup might get very dry and stick to the pan. To avoid this,
        throw in some water during the cooking process if necessary.</li>
        <li>You can actually freeze the soup and, whenever you need some, simply heat it
        up in the microwave.</li>
    </ul>
