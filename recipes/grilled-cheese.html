    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>grilled cheese</strong> sandwich is a food from the 
    US, served hot and usually eaten with <a>tomato soup</a>. There are
    countless ways to do them, but this recipe covers the traditional one.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This sandwich is crispy, creamy and tasty, and the taste is simple yet
        wonderful. Some would say it's too simple, hence the variants. With a few
        simple ingredients, anyone can cook this delicacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pieces of bread (sourdough is recommended but optional)</li>
        <li>Semi-hard cheese (eg. gouda, gruyere, provolone) or any cheese that <strong>melts easily</strong></li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Butter <em>(if you don't have you can use oil and it works fine)</em></li>
        <li><em>(Optional) tomato soup</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the cheese if necessary. You can grate it, cut it into
        thin layers, or whatever technique you prefer. Just make sure
        you don't put too big chunks or else the cheese won't melt.
        </li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the microwave. Turn on a panini maker 
        or a pan on medium heat. Spread the melted butter into the bread and toast
        the inner side of the bread. Once golden brown, take them out of
        the heat.</li>
        <li>Pour some mayonnaise into the golden side of the bread to
        give it some creaminess <em>(don't worry, you won't taste
        warm mayo)</em>. Then, put the cheese inside and close the
        sandwich.</li>
        <li>Spread more butter into the outer-sides of the breads. Toast
        both sides until the cheese is completely melted and the bread is
        golden and crispy. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Possible mistakes (and how you can fix them)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If the cheese hasn't melted and the bread is already golden,
        turn down the heat. The pan is too hot.</li>
        <li>If, on the other hand, the pan is too low, the cheese will
        melt and the bread will still be pale.</li>
        <li>If you find it difficult to spread the melted butter on the bread,
        you can use a cooking brush. If you don't want to do so, you can avoid
        melting the butter. Simply make sure that the butter is warm before spreading
        it onto the breads.
        </li>
        <li>If you don't have or want to use butter, any fat will work just fine.
        Olive oil, sunflower oil or even mayonnaise will work just fine.
        </li>
    </ul>
