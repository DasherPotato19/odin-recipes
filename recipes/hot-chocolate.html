    <h2 class="chocolate">Desctiption</h2>
    <p>To top it all off, a good drink is necessary during winter. That's why
    we are offering a recipe for hot chocolate. There are many styles, but this
    is the one which isn't extremely complicated but it tastes amazing.</p>
    <p>Some might even dip their food into the hot chocolate, such as pastries.
    What I don't find appealing at all is marshmallows; they just ruin the drink
    by sweetening it too much. If you want to add sugar to make it sweet, go on. But,
    bear in mind that the chocolate has already got some sugar.</p>

    <div id="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200 ml of milk</li>
            <li>30 to 50 gr of chocolate</li>
            <li><em><strong>(Optional)</strong> sugar</em></li>
            <li><em><strong>(Optional)</strong> anise, cinnamon and any other spice you like</em></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="chocolate">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop down the chocolate into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Throw the ingredients except for the milk into a pot, then cover with milk, but
        use as little milk as possible. Save the rest for later.</li>
        <li>Cook the hot chocolate in extremely low heat for about 15 mintues. As low as possible. Stir
        occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Let it cool down for a few minutes, then strain it and enjoy!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><span id="tips">Tips</span> and <span id="warnings">warnings</span></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>How to choose the best chocolate:</strong> there are two
        main rules that you have to follow to make a great hot chocolate. These
        are:
        <ol>
            <li>The fewer the ingredients, the better</li>
            <li>The darker, the better</li>
        </ol>
        Using white chocolate is a <strong>sin</strong> and <em>it deserves
        hate</em>.
        </li>
        <li>While cooking, the milk might evaporate. In that case, <strong>immediately
        turn off the heat</strong>, or else the milk is going to overflow and it's going
        to be a mess. After that, stir the hot chocolate slowly for around a minute, and
        turn on the heat once again. Don't stop the timer.</li>
        <li>If you want more creaminess, you can do one of two things: either use less
        milk or cook it for a longer time.</li>
    </ul>
